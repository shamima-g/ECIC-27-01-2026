Can you read and undertand a screen video recording


_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

No, I cannot directly read or process video files. My capabilities are limited to:

- **Images** (PNG, JPG, GIF, etc.) - I can view and analyze these
- **PDFs** - I can read text and visual content
- **Jupyter notebooks** - I can read cells and outputs

If you have a screen recording you'd like me to understand, here are some alternatives:

1. **Extract key frames as images** - Use a tool like FFmpeg to extract screenshots at specific timestamps, then share those images with me
2. **Take screenshots** - Capture the important moments manually and share them
3. **Describe what's happening** - Tell me what the video shows and I can help from there

Would any of these approaches work for your situation?
