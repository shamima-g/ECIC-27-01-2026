**Current State Issue Detected**

The workflow state file shows:
- **Epic 1**: COMPLETE âœ“
- **Epic 2**: COMPLETE âœ“
- **Epic 3**: IMPLEMENT â† **This epic was deleted**

According to the session log from earlier today, you requested deletion of Epic 3 (Data Confirmation & Validation), which was committed as `9b08765`.

The workflow state is now stale and needs to be updated to skip Epic 3 and proceed to Epic 4 (Instruments & Index Prices).

**How would you like to proceed?**

1. **Update workflow state to Epic 4** - I'll transition the state to mark Epic 3 as skipped/complete and move to Epic 4's SPECIFY phase
2. **Start fresh** - Reset the workflow entirely
3. **Something else** - Please describe

Would you like me to update the workflow state to continue with Epic 4?

Now I have the context I need. Let me create the wireframes for the Data Confirmation & Validation feature.

## Proposed Screens

Based on the spec, this feature needs the following screens:
