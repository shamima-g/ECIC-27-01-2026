What changes would you like to make to Epic 2?

Story 5: Remove this story as it is catered for in Story 3 (You cancel and file and then just upload it again, no specific re-import flow)
Story 6: Looks good, however, be more specific about the LastExecutedActivityName
When LastExecutedActivityName = "PrepareData", then file upload, data maintenance and data confirmation screens are accessible
WHen LastExecutedActivityName IN ("ApproveFirstLevel", "ApproveSecondLevel", "ApproveThirdLevel", "PendingComplete"), then file upload, data maintenance and data confirmation screens are inaccessible

I'll make both changes:

1. **Remove Story 5** (re-import is covered in Story 3)
2. **Update Story 6** with specific `LastExecutedActivityName` access rules
