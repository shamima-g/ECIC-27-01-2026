Looking at the screenshot, I can see a 400 Bad Request error on the file upload POST request. The console shows "Body: [Unable to parse body]" which suggests the request body format is incorrect.

Let me check the OpenAPI spec for the file upload endpoint and the current implementation.

Let me check the OpenAPI spec for the exact upload endpoint requirements.

Found the issue! According to the OpenAPI spec, **`FilelogId` is required** (line 352: `required: true`), but the code at [FileUploadModal.tsx:141-144](web/src/components/file-import/FileUploadModal.tsx#L141-L144) only includes it conditionally for re-uploads:

```typescript
// Only include FilelogId if it exists (for re-uploads)
if (fileLogId) {
  uploadParams.FilelogId = fileLogId;
}
```

For a new upload (when `fileLogId` is undefined), the parameter is omitted, causing the 400 Bad Request.

Let me check the API client implementation to see how the upload works.

The issue is clear. The OpenAPI spec requires `FilelogId` for ALL uploads, but for a **new upload** there's no FileLogId yet (it's created as the result of the upload).

This seems like either:
1. An API specification issue (FilelogId shouldn't be required for initial uploads)
2. Or the parent component should be creating/providing a FileLogId before uploading

Let me check how the modal is being called to see if `fileLogId` should be passed.

Now I understand the issue. When a file has status "Not Uploaded", `selectedFile.file.FileLogId` is likely `undefined` because no file log entry exists yet. But the API requires `FilelogId`.

Let me check if there's an endpoint to create a file log entry first, or if the API expects a default value.

**Root Cause Found:**

The OpenAPI spec at line 349-353 shows `FilelogId: required: true`, but for a **new upload** (status "Not Uploaded"), there's no FileLogId yet. The current code only sends `FilelogId` when it exists (for re-uploads).

**Solution:** For new uploads, pass `0` as the `FilelogId` to indicate it's a new file (the API will create a new FileLog entry and return the ID in the response).

Fixed. The issue was that `FilelogId` is **required** by the API, but the code was only sending it for re-uploads. 

**The fix:** Send `FilelogId: fileLogId || 0` - this uses the existing ID for re-uploads, or `0` for new uploads to signal the API should create a new file log entry.

Let me verify the tests still pass.

The test expects `FilelogId` to be undefined for new uploads, but the API requires it. Let me update the test to match the correct API behavior.

All 16 tests pass. 

**Summary of the fix:**

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| [FileUploadModal.tsx:131-141](web/src/components/file-import/FileUploadModal.tsx#L131-L141) | Added `FilelogId: fileLogId || 0` - sends `0` for new uploads (required by API) |
| [story-3-file-upload-modal.test.tsx:353-355](web/src/__tests__/epic-2/story-3-file-upload-modal.test.tsx#L353-L355) | Updated test to expect `0` instead of `undefined` |

**Root cause:** The OpenAPI spec at [FileImporterAPIDefinition.yaml:349-353](documentation/FileImporterAPIDefinition.yaml) shows `FilelogId: required: true`, but the code was only sending it for re-uploads. For new uploads, the API expects `0` to signal it should create a new file log entry.
