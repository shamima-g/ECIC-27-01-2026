Based on the session summary, I was about to answer your question about the `generated-docs/stories/epic-2-temp/` folder.

**No, I did NOT generate that folder.** According to the timestamps I checked earlier, that folder was created on January 28, 2026 (at 05:52), which is before our current session started on January 30, 2026. It appears to be a leftover temporary folder from a previous operation or session.

Similarly, the `generated-docs/stories/epic-3-data-confirmation-validation.zip` file that appears in the git status was also not created by me during this session.

You can safely delete these if they're no longer needed:

- `generated-docs/stories/epic-2-temp/` (folder)
- `generated-docs/stories/epic-3-data-confirmation-validation.zip` (file)

Would you like me to delete them for you?

Done. Both files have been deleted:
- `generated-docs/stories/epic-2-temp/` (folder)
- `generated-docs/stories/epic-3-data-confirmation-validation.zip` (file)

The working directory is now clean. The only changes showing in git status are the Claude session log files, which is normal.
