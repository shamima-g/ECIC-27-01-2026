**Result:**
Good! The test files exist. The validation warning is a false positive - the script is looking for filenames with "epic-1" in them, but our files are named "story-N-*.test.tsx" inside an "epic-1" directory, which is a better organization pattern. The transition was successful (status: "ok"), so we c...

**Current Workflow State:**

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Feature | InvestInsight-Product-Guide-v2 |
| Epic | 1 - Foundation & Start Page |
| Phase | SPECIFY |
| Stories | 5 defined, 0 tests written |
| Resume From | story-1-home-page-setup |

The PLAN phase is complete with all 9 epics and 53 stories defined. You're now in the **SPECIFY** phase for Epic 1, which means the `test-generator` agent needs to create failing tests from the acceptance criteria.

**Is this correct?** If so, I'll invoke the test-generator agent to start creating tests for Epic 1's stories.

### Workflow State

The workflow has been transitioned to **IMPLEMENT** phase.

---

## Context Checkpoint

Before proceeding to implementation, clearing context is recommended to give the developer agent a fresh start with maximum capacity for code generation.

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

To continue with a fresh context:

1. Run `/clear` to clear the conversation
2. Run `/continue` to resume the workflow

The workflow state is saved - when you run `/continue`, you'll resume at **Epic 1 IMPLEMENT phase** ready to start making tests pass.
