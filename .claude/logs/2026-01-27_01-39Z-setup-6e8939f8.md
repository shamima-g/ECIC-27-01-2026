I found the **InvestInsight** feature specification - a comprehensive portfolio reporting and data stewardship platform with:

- **12 detailed screens** (Start Page, File Uploads, Data Confirmation, Instruments, Index Prices, Durations & YTM, Instrument Betas, Credit Ratings, Report Comments, Approvals L1-L3, Process Logs, Administration)
- **Reference Data maintenance** for countries, currencies, portfolios, indexes, etc.
- **Multi-level approval workflow** (Data Preparation â†’ L1 â†’ L2 â†’ L3 â†’ Complete)
- **3 OpenAPI specs** for API integration

The wireframes directory is currently empty.

---

**This feature involves significant UI.** Would you like me to:

1. **Create wireframes first** using the ui-ux-designer agent, then proceed to planning
2. **Proceed directly to planning** with the feature-planner agent

Which approach would you prefer?

_**User: shamima-g (2026-01-27 01:50Z)**_

Create wireframes first

**Result:**
Thank you for the detailed specification. I've reviewed the InvestInsight Product Guide and identified all the screens that need wireframes. Let me present the comprehensive list for your approval.

## Proposed Screens

Based on the spec, this feature needs the following screens:

Perfect! All wireframes are complete. Now let me commit all remaining wireframes and then provide the final summary.

Now let me provide you with the completion summary:

## DESIGN Phase Complete âœ…

The **ui-ux-designer** has created wireframes for all **28 screens**. Files saved to `generated-docs/wireframes/`:

| Category | Screens |
|----------|---------|
| Core Workflow | Start Page, Portfolio Imports, Other Imports, File Upload Modal, Data Confirmation (3 tabs) |
| Data Maintenance | Instruments, Index Prices, Durations & YTM, Betas, Credit Ratings, Report Comments |
| Approvals & Monitoring | L1/L2/L3 Approvals, Process Logs (File, Monthly, Calculation) |
| Administration | User Management, Role Management, Page Access |
| Reference Data | Countries, Currencies, Portfolios, Indexes, Asset Managers, Benchmarks |

**Key design patterns:**
- Consistent data grids with CRUD modals
- Clickable status icons (âœ“ complete, âœ— failed, â³ processing, â—‹ missing)
- Tab-based organization for related content
- Audit trail support on all maintenance screens
- Workflow state locking after First Approval

---

**Would you like to clear context before proceeding to the PLAN phase?** (Recommended: yes)

- **Yes** â†’ Run `/clear` then `/continue` to start fresh
- **No** â†’ I'll proceed directly to the feature-planner
