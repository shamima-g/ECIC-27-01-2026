# Testing Guide

This guide provides detailed testing patterns and examples for the project. For quick reference, see the Testing Strategy section in [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md).

## Testing Framework

The project uses **Vitest** with **React Testing Library** for comprehensive testing, with a focus on **integration tests** over unit tests.

## Test Organization

All tests are centralized in `web/src/__tests__/` with subdirectories by test type:

```
web/src/__tests__/
├── integration/    # Integration tests (primary focus)
├── scripts/        # Template tooling and script tests
└── api/            # API endpoint tests (if needed)
```

### Files You Should NOT Create

- `src/__tests__/utils/` - Avoid standalone utility tests; test utilities through integration
- `constants.test.ts` - Constants have no behavior to test
- `types.test.ts` - TypeScript compiler validates types
- `*-schemas.test.ts` - Don't test Zod/Yup directly; test validation via form/API integration

### Test File Naming

- Use `.test.ts` for non-React tests (API, utils)
- Use `.test.tsx` for React component/page tests
- Use descriptive names: `api-client.test.ts`, `page-rendering.test.tsx`, `user-workflow.test.tsx`

## Integration Test Focus

Integration tests verify that multiple parts of your application work together:

- API client + error handling + data transformation
- Component + API calls + state management
- Complete user workflows (load page → fetch data → interact → verify result)
- Authentication flows
- Form submissions with validation and API integration

## Best Practices

1. **Test realistic workflows**: Focus on what users actually do
2. **Strategic API Mocking**: Use mocking only for scenarios that are difficult or impossible to reproduce with a live test API
3. **Arrange-Act-Assert pattern**: Keep tests structured and readable
4. **Descriptive test names**: Describe the scenario, not the implementation
5. **User-centric queries**: Use `screen.getByRole`, `getByLabelText` (accessibility-first)
6. **User interactions**: Use `userEvent` (not `fireEvent`) for realistic interactions
7. **Async testing**: Always use `waitFor` for async operations
8. **Test error states**: Don't just test the happy path

## Acceptance Test Quality Checklist

Before writing any test, ask: **"Would a user care if this broke?"**

Every test MUST pass this checklist:

| Question | If NO, don't write the test |
|----------|----------------------------|
| Does this test verify something a user can see or interact with? | Skip it |
| Would a product manager understand what this test validates? | Rewrite it |
| Could this test fail even if the feature works correctly for users? | Delete it |
| Does the test name describe a user outcome, not an implementation detail? | Rename it |

### Valid Acceptance Tests Verify

- User can see specific content ("Total: $1,234" is displayed)
- User can perform actions (clicking "Submit" saves the form)
- User receives feedback (error message appears when validation fails)
- User workflow completes (login → redirect to dashboard)
- Accessibility requirements (screen reader can navigate the form)

### Invalid Tests (DO NOT WRITE)

- Component has correct CSS class names
- Internal state updates to specific value
- Function is called N times
- Component renders N child elements
- Props are passed correctly to child components
- Redux/state store contains expected shape
- SVG has correct attributes (fill, stroke, dimensions)
- Animation classes are applied
- Internal DOM structure matches expectations
- Constants or config objects have expected values
- TypeScript types work correctly (compiler handles this)
- Third-party library behavior (Zod schemas validate, NextAuth sessions work, etc.)

## Query Priority (Accessibility-First)

Use queries in this order of preference:

| Priority | Query | When to Use |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| 1st | `getByRole` | Buttons, links, headings, forms - **preferred for most elements** |
| 2nd | `getByLabelText` | Form inputs with labels |
| 3rd | `getByPlaceholderText` | Inputs without visible labels |
| 4th | `getByText` | Non-interactive content |
| 5th | `getByDisplayValue` | Filled form inputs |
| **Last resort** | `getByTestId` | **Only when no semantic query works** |

**`getByTestId` is an anti-pattern in most cases.** If you find yourself adding `data-testid` attributes, first ask: "Is there a semantic HTML element or ARIA role I should use instead?" The answer is usually yes.

## Anti-Pattern: Testing Library Internals

Do NOT write tests that query internal DOM structures of third-party components. This is a common mistake with visualization libraries (Recharts, Chart.js, D3), rich text editors, and complex UI components.

### Bad - Testing Implementation Details

```typescript
// Testing Recharts internal SVG rendering
expect(container.querySelector('.recharts-bar-rectangle')).toHaveAttribute('fill', '#8884d8');
expect(screen.getByTestId('chart').querySelectorAll('rect')).toHaveLength(5);
```

### Good - Testing User-Observable Behavior

```typescript
// Test that data is accessible (via sr-only text or aria-labels)
expect(screen.getByText('Sales: $1,234')).toBeInTheDocument();

// Test that the chart container renders
expect(screen.getByRole('img', { name: /sales chart/i })).toBeInTheDocument();

// Test loading/error states
expect(screen.getByText('Loading chart...')).toBeInTheDocument();
```

### Why This Matters

1. Internal DOM structure can change between library versions (brittle tests)
2. jsdom cannot render SVG/Canvas properly (tests will fail or be meaningless)
3. These tests don't verify what users actually see
4. Visual verification belongs in E2E tests (Playwright/Cypress) or visual regression tools

### For Charts and Visualizations Specifically

- Test that the component renders without crashing
- Test data transformation/formatting functions separately
- Test loading, error, and empty states
- Use accessibility features (aria-labels, sr-only text) to verify data display
- Defer visual correctness testing to E2E or manual QA

## Test Mock Requirements

When tests fail due to mock issues, you MUST fix the mocks - never skip tests to avoid fixing them.

### Common Mock Issues and Fixes

**1. Multiple API calls:**

```typescript
// WRONG: Only handles first call
mockGet.mockResolvedValue(data);

// RIGHT: Handles multiple calls
mockGet.mockResolvedValue(data); // If all calls return same shape
// OR
mockGet
  .mockResolvedValueOnce(bloombergData)
  .mockResolvedValueOnce(custodianData);
```

**2. Context providers not wrapped:**

```typescript
vi.mock('@/contexts/ToastContext', () => ({
  useToast: () => ({ showToast: vi.fn() }),
  ToastProvider: ({ children }) => children
}));
```

**3. Navigation mocks:**

```typescript
vi.mock('next/navigation', () => ({
  useRouter: () => ({ push: vi.fn(), refresh: vi.fn() }),
  usePathname: () => '/current-path',
  useSearchParams: () => new URLSearchParams()
}));
```

**4. Async state updates:**

```typescript
await waitFor(() => {
  expect(screen.getByText('Expected')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### When `.skip()` Is Acceptable

**Never use `describe.skip()` or `it.skip()` to bypass failing tests due to mock issues.**

The only acceptable uses of skip are:
- Tests for features not yet implemented (TDD red phase)
- Tests that require capabilities not available in the test environment (e.g., actual browser APIs)

If you encounter a mock issue you cannot solve, ask the user for help rather than skipping the test.

## Template Test Examples

Reference these tests for patterns:

- [api-client.test.ts](../../web/src/__tests__/integration/api-client.test.ts) - API client integration testing
- [page-rendering.test.tsx](../../web/src/__tests__/integration/page-rendering.test.tsx) - Component + data fetching integration
- [auth-helpers.test.ts](../../web/src/__tests__/integration/auth-helpers.test.ts) - RBAC helper functions
- [rbac.test.ts](../../web/src/__tests__/integration/rbac.test.ts) - Role-based access control integration
- [validation-schemas.test.ts](../../web/src/__tests__/integration/validation-schemas.test.ts) - Zod validation schemas
- [generate-progress-index.test.ts](../../web/src/__tests__/scripts/generate-progress-index.test.ts) - Script testing

## What NOT to Test

- Simple utility functions (unless complex logic)
- Third-party library code
- Trivial getters/setters
- TypeScript types (let the compiler handle it)
