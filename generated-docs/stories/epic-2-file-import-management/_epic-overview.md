# Epic 2: File Import Management

## Description

This epic implements the file upload and management functionality for portfolio data and other required files. Users will be able to upload files via manual upload, view file validation status in a matrix/grid format, and manage file errors. The implementation includes two dashboards: Portfolio Imports (matrix view) and Other Imports (list view).
